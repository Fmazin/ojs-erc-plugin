In the upper right corner you can change the layers. You can choose between an \"OpenStreetMap\" layer and an \"Esri World Imagery\" layer. You can also set whether the geometric shape(s) and the administrative unit should be displayed or not. For the administrative unit you will find a more detailed description in the next paragraph (Coverage Information). Below the layer control you will find a search for the map. You can search for locations and by hitting \"Enter\" you will be offered different locations that match your input. By clicking on a suggestion it will be accepted and a matching rectangle, describing the boundaries of the location, will be displayed on the map. This rectangle can also be deleted/ edited by clicking on the trash-/ edit icon on the left side.

The administrative unit (in black) which is the lowest common denominator for all geometric shape(s) is shown in the map.
