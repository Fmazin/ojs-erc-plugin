# Abstract
*geoOJS* offers a novel way for authors to provide spatial properties of research works when submitting an article to a journal based on the open source software Open Journal Systems (OJS, https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/)

The plugin adds the functionality, that the author can specify the articles content in terms of geospatial metadata during the submission process for submitting an article ("3. Enter Metadata").

Authors can either search for a location and accept the suggested bounding box or manually create one or more suitable geometric shape(s) on a map. If authors enter geometries, a gazetteer is used to suggest a matching administrative unit’s name to the author. This allows geoOJS to store geospatial data in two forms: as text, using an administrative unit or standardised geographical norm data, and as geospatial coordinates in GeoJSON format. <br>
Thereby the coordinates are stored accurately, while at the same time a textual description is accessible and flexible for non-map-related usage. In addition to displaying geospatial information on maps, it is also added to the HTML source code of article’s landing pages in a semantically meaningful way. <br> 
In the article view, the properties specified by the author are then displayed and available for download as geoJSON.

The plugin was developed as part of a bachelor thesis. This thesis can be found here: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:hbz:6-69029469735. In addition, the plugin was presented at The Munin Conference on Scholarly Publishing 2020. Abstract, recording and slides can be found here: https://doi.org/10.7557/5.5590 or on youtube: https://youtu.be/-Lc9AjHq_AY.


# Download & Installation 
- to use the plugin, OJS must be running locally (further information you can find here: https://github.com/pkp/ojs)
- download the plugin here as ```geoOJS.zip```
- rename the unzipped folder ```geoOJS-master``` to ```geoOJS```
- insert the folder ```geoOJS``` in the path ```ojs/plugins/generic/``` in OJS 
- activate the plugin geoOJS in the OJS plug-in settings 
- Specify your geonames username
- If you want to disable CDN you can do it [here](https://github.com/tnier01/geoOJS/wiki/Disable-CDN)

# Specify geonames username 
- You have to specify your username for the geonames api, so that an alignment for the administrative units is possible. 
- Create an account on https://www.geonames.org/login 
- Enter the username in the geoOJS plug-in settings (OJS -> Settings -> Website -> Plugins -> Installed Plugins -> geoOJS -> blue arrow -> Settings)!
