# Creation of a Release

These instructions describe the procedure for creating a new release.

1. In the file `version.xml` the version number must be adjusted according to the changes made (`major.minor.bugfix`) and the date must be updated. 
2. The changes made must be recorded in the file `CHANGELOG.md` file with `version number` and `date` sorted by `Added`, `Fixed`, `Changed` and identifiable as `Unreleased` or `Release`.
3. Via the link https://github.com/o2r-project/ojs-erc-plugin/releases/new a new release must be created in github with corresponding `tag`-version, `title` and `description`. 
4. ~~The release must be republished in the `OJS Plugin Gallery`. A description for this step can be found via this link https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/plugin-guide/en/release.~~  (This step should be carried out at a later stage, since the plugin is currently in WIP state)
